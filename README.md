# Pandas vs Polars Comparison Project

ðŸš§ **This project is currently in progress** ðŸš§

## Overview

This project aims to compare the performance and features of two popular data manipulation libraries: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/). The comparison will cover various aspects such as speed, memory usage, and ease of use.

## Goals

- Evaluate the performance of Pandas and Polars in different data manipulation tasks.
- Compare memory usage between the two libraries.
- Assess the ease of use and API design.
- Provide detailed examples and benchmarks.

## Project Status

- **Current Status:** In progress
- **Next Steps:** 
  - Set up benchmarking environment
  - Implement data manipulation tasks in both libraries
  - Collect and analyze performance data

## Installation

To run the comparisons on your local machine, you need to have both Pandas and Polars installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
poetry install
```
